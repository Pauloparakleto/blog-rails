      <p class="py-2 lg:mr-16">I'm a web developer mostly working with Ruby on Rails.</p>

      <p class="py-2 lg:mr-16">I am currently helping companies build their own online training academies at <a href="https://trybugle.com" target="_blank" class="underline">bugle</a>.

      <p class="py-2 lg:mr-16">Before making a career switch to programming, I graduated in business management and accepted a few business roles in digital/tech companies.</p>

      <p class="py-2 lg:mr-16">Maybe that's why I love all things product and always try to develop with the complete value chain in mind.</p>

      <p class="py-2 lg:mr-16">TDD, clean and performant code are some of my favourite topics and I like to discuss them at work, on
        <a href="https://twitter.com/akbns" target="_blank" class="underline">Twitter</a>
        and through <a href="/posts" class="underline">writing</a>.</p>

      <p class="py-2 lg:mr-16">You can also find some of my code on <a href="https://github.com/anansilva" target="_blank" class="underline">GitHub</a>.</p>
